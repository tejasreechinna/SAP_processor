# SAP_processor
This repository contains my Verilog implementation of the SAP-1 processor, an 8-bit microprocessor with a simple instruction set, ALU, registers, memory, and control unit. It demonstrates the fetch-decode-execute cycle and is ideal for learning basic CPU architecture. A testbench is included for simulating the processor's operations.
